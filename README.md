# Wire-Puzzles
This is a game being created by Vitridax, VoidOverflow, and that person who keeps changing her name, currently known as Mordellia Darcy. The point of the game is to control a character to place wires and get power from one point to another to continue. This game is still in its very early stages, so right now that's pretty much as specific as it gets.

Because this uses Phaser.js, it must be run from a web server in order to work. I recommend using the Web Server for Chrome add-on if you use chrome. Or you can use the github html previewer to play it straight from your browser on both a phone, and a computer: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Vitridax/Wire-Puzzles/blob/master/index.html.
